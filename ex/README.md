**2.2 Genes.** In cells, DNA contains fundamental information so that the organism provides all the functions useful to live. To support the cell functions, instructions in DNA are first transcribed into RNA molecules. Later, RNA molecules get translated into proteins. Translation from  RNA to messenger RNA (mRNA) to proteins is based on genetic code, which is the set of rules in which a sequence of nucleotides (`'A'`, `'C'`, `'U'` and `'G'`) gets translated in a sequence of amino acids for proteic synthesis. Each amino acid corresponds to one or more sequences of 3 nucleotides, called *codons*. The following table shows the codon that in mRNA code the 20 ordinary amino acids.

|Amino acid|Codons|Amino acid|Codons|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Ala|GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG|Leu|UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG|
|Arg|CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, AGG|Lys|AAA, AAG|
|Asn|AAU, AAC|Met|AUG|
|Asp|GAU, GAC|Phe|UUU, UUC|
|Cys|UGU, UGC|Pro|CCU, CCC, CCA, CCG|
|Gln|CAA, CAG|Ser|UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC|
|Glu|GAA, GAG|Thr|ACU, ACC, ACA, ACG|
|Gly|GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG|Trp|UGG|
|His|CAU, CAC|Tyr|UAU, UAC|
|Ile|AUU, AUC, AUA|Val|GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG|

Following codons indicate the start and the end of the translation process. Note, start codon also codificates Methionine ('Met').

|Instruction|Codons|
| :- | :- |
|start|AUG, GUG|
|stop|UAG, UGA, UAA|

Write a program elaborating a sequence of mRNA inserted as an input from the user, showing the sequence of amino acid translated. To simulate the translation problem, use a dictionary genetic_code, which, reading all info reported as a table in `genetic_code.csv`, memorizes codons and amino acids codified by those codons, choosing opportune keys and values. Then, iterate through the sequence inserted by the user until you find a `'start'`. Iterate through the next part memorizing the result of the translation in a list called protein.  Translation shall stop when the `'stop'` sequence is found. Example: starting from the sequence (`'start'` and `'stop'` are underlined), `GUAUGCACGUGACUUUCCUCAUGAGCUGAU`, the program shall output: `MetHisValThrPheLeuMetSerstop`. If no codon of 'start' and 'stop' is found, then output an error.
